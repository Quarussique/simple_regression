Seems to work quiet well with given alpha and epsilon. 
Input is a file of training example pairs.
Output is theta0 and theta1 of the hypothesis function.
"datasettest" is a test dataset thas should output 0 and 1
"dataset" is a more really looking dataset (should output smth around 418 and 13)
In case of divergency try changing alpha and epsilon variables.
